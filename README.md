## _Brief introduction to Apapche Spark cluster computing on AWS_
## Here we use the some training dataset and some validation dataset that we can use to train a model to predict the last column, the `quality` column.

## Setup

First, I uploaded the `TrainingDataset-fixed.csv` & `ValidationDataset-fixed.csv` to my AFS account and they can now be found [here](http://web.njit.edu/~as2757/cs643/TrainingDataset-fixed.csv) & [here](http://web.njit.edu/~as2757/cs643/ValidationDataset-fixed.csv) respectively.
